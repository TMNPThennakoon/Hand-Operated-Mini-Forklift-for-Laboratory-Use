## 🧱 Why This Project Was Important

Manual lifting in workshops, small storage areas, and home environments can cause:
- **Physical strain and injuries** to workers
- **Loss of efficiency** in material handling operations
- **Increased labor requirements** (multiple people needed for heavy loads)
- **Higher risk of accidents** during manual handling

This project addresses these challenges by providing a **safer and more efficient manual handling solution** that reduces physical effort and improves workplace safety.
